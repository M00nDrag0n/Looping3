  <h1>ICE CREAM-RELATED QUESTIONS FROM YOUR LOCAL CALCULUS PROFESSOR</h1>
  <h2>You're walking into the Ben and Jerry's, and the clerk literally asks you this series of questions. You cannot escape.</h2>
<div class="container">
<form id = "input">
  <h3><strong>Before you even look at the menu, the clerk looks at you with demonic, green eyes, and a posessed expression:</strong></h3>
  <label for="topping1"><span class="professor">Do you like chocolate or pineapple on your split?</span></label>
  <input id="topping1">


<h4><strong>When you reach for your cell phone to call the police, you are interjected by a voice inside your head. You think it's the clerk, but the clerk is silently staring at you with those green eyes. Before you can even think about walking out that door, a whole line of people is blocking the exit and impatiently waiting for their ice cream. Every one of the impatient customers is staring daggers into the back of your head disapprovingly ahd giving you the look of "you better hurry up if you want your ice cream". One parent has a look of "Will you please hurry I gotta take my kids to the vet" on her face.</strong></h4>
<h4>The professor asks once more:</h4>
  <label for="wyr1"><span class="professor">Would you rather have, at random times during the consumption of your ice cream, lots of whole coffee beans or waaaaay too much vanilla extract directly inside your cone?</span></label>
  <input id="wyr1">
